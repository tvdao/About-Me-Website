              <p class="introduction">I am a Junior at the University of California, San Diego studying Computer Science. I am very interested in the field of Computer Science and want to learn more 
                through internships and projects. I am seeking a software engineering internship for the summer of 2021!

                <p> Whenever I have a project in mind, mainly old games I used to play like Blackjack and Connect Four, I always write out the methods and their purpose along with the underlying data strcture.
                  I then take those notes I initially wrote and begin implementing them in the language I want to practice in. This is how I usually start my projects and 
                  I think it helps gives me a clear direction in the project.

                <h3>Learning & Applying Concepts</h3>
                <p> In progamming, I love that once you learn a data structure or algorithm, you can immediately implement it into a project. I learn better from practice and actually
                  using the concepts I learn. So I always try to apply the concepts in my own self-interest projects or reinforce what I learn through homework in my classes. I think this 
                  is a very useful skill since I tend to pick up concepts faster from it.
